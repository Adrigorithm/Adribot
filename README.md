# Halted

This project is paused until either D#+ fixes their stuff or I port the whole thing to Discord.Net

# Adribot

A feature rich general purpose discord bot written in C# using a discord api wrapper.

## Features

This list showcases a few of the more **visual** features and does in no way cover everything this bot does.

### Fetch pictures of your favourite animals (currently supports cat, fox and dog)!

### Translate discord emoji's into an emoji format understandable by Minecraft

### Schedules input from a calendar and notifies you beforehand (supports a specific format only for now because my University creates horrendous calendar files - everything in one string with newlines)

## Deployment

There are currently no official releases. In order to deploy the bot you will need to build the solution yourself following these steps (follow these carefully unless you know exactly what you're doing).

- Clone the project
- Create `Adribot/secret/config.json` (it should look something like this)

    ```json
    {
        "botToken": "getThisFromDiscordDevPortalIAmRandom3489407",
        "catToken": "getThisFromTheCatApiDeezNuts38907432",
        "sqlConnectionString": "Server=YourMomsBasement;Database=VisitorLogs;User Id=YourMom;Password=AVerySecretPassword",
        "embedColour": "#191970",
        "devUserId": 123456789010111213
    }
    ```
    The embedColour is used to colourise the left border of embeds generated by the bot.
    
    devUserId is your discord user Id (This is used so the developer can perform certain admin functions (for testing) without having the required permissions)

- Get all the required dependencies (run `dotnet restore` if not done automatically)
- Create the database model using EF Core: `dotnet ef migrations add "InitialCreate"`
- Creete the actual database (make sure the database can be reached using the above connectionString): `dotnet ef database update`
- Provided everything went well you should now be able to build/run the bot. Since this is a dotnet core console app, you can run this on any OS (containers work fine too), just make sure you have a .net9 capable runtime and a mssql database

## Contributing

I'm not expecting any contributions but if you're interested, you're free to do so. The first thing you should do is follow the steps in the `Deploy` section.

Wait where are all the branches? Yes that's right there's only one branch. Due to the above I will only adapt to more branches if people will actually contribute - it's just more convenient this way -, so yes if commit your changes you should use the feature branching pattern.

## FAQ

#### Can I create user bots with this?

No you cannot. It is against Discord TOS. Do not scam/spam/... or avoid paying for nitro, it's just morally/ethically unacceptable.

#### Can we get this feature or bug fixed?

Probably, create an issue for it.

#### Do you like cats?

Yes.

## Todo

- [ ] Add automatic online ical sync
