# Adribot

A feature rich general purpose discord bot written in C# using a discord api wrapper.

## Features

This list showcases a few of the more **visual** features and does in no way cover everything this bot does.

### Fetch pictures of your favourite animals (currently supports cat, fox and dog)!

### Translate discord emoji's into an emoji format understandable by Minecraft

### Schedules input from a calendar and notifies you beforehand (supports a specific format only for now because my University creates horrendous calendar files - everything in one string with newlines)

## Deployment

soon

## Contributing

I'm not expecting any contributions but if you're interested, you're free to do so. The first thing you should do is follow the steps in the `Deploy` section.

Wait where are all the branches? Yes that's right there's only one branch. Due to the above I will only adapt to more branches if people will actually contribute - it's just more convenient this way -, so yes if commit your changes you should use the feature branching pattern.

## FAQ

#### Can I create user bots with this?

No you cannot. It is against Discord TOS. Do not scam/spam/... or avoid paying for nitro, it's just morally/ethically unacceptable.

#### Can we get this feature or bug fixed?

Probably, create an issue for it.

#### Do you like cats?

Yes.

## Todo

- [ ] Add automatic online ical sync
- [ ] Provide clearer error messages / feedback for end user (in progress)
- [ ] Add NMBS data access
- [ ] ~~Add DeLijn data access~~ (impossible without scraping)

## Support

Please create an issue. If not applicable or your question is too specific you can contact me through discord. My pomelo name is `adrigorithm`.

ps: Pomelo is a fruit üçä
